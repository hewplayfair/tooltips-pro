# Tooltips Pro
Advanced tooltip functionality for Godot 4.x
## Features
- **Tooltips Everywhere**: Tooltips can be attached to any **Control** node, as well as **2D** and **3D** nodes.
- **Customizable Layout**: Set **Alignment**, **Offset**, and **Overflow Mode** to fully control how tooltips should be positioned, and adjust to overflowing the screen bounds.
- **Origin Options**: Anchor a tooltip to the node that triggered it, the mouse position, or any arbitrary position with a remote node.
- **Nesting Tooltips**: Put tooltips within tooltips, and trigger them through a fully featured locking system of the kind established in *Crusader Kings III*.
- **Dynamic Content**: Use String placeholders to insert variables into tooltips and see the text update while they're open.
- **Template Appearances**: Customize tooltip templates using the full power of Godot's UI system, for reuse or unique one-offs.
- **Localization support, animations, and more!**

## Installation
**Tooltips Pro** can be downloaded and installed through the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset).

After enabling the plugin in your Godot project, you should reload the editor using **Project > Reload Current Project**.

The **res:\\addons\tooltips_pro\examples** folder is not required, but it's strongly recommended that you keep it for reference. 

## Tutorials
The included example scenes have tooltips set up in most configurations.

The scene UIs were created at 1920x1080. To properly display the example scenes, set **Viewport Width** and **Viewport Height** to 1920x1080 in **Project Settings > Display > Window**. You may also need to set **Mode** to Maximized or Fullscreen.

The best way to learn is to study how things are set up in the example scene and play around with your own tooltips. See the [wiki](https://github.com/hewplayfair/tooltips-pro/wiki) on the GitHub plugin page for a few tutorials to help you get started.
